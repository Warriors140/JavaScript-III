/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. When a function is in a global scope, the value of "this" inside of the function becomes
     the window object.
* 2. When a function is called by a previous dot, the object before that dot is now "this".
* 3. When a constructor function is used, "this" is refered to the specific instance of the
     object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
* 4. When JavaScript's "call" or "apply" method is used, "this" is explicitly defined.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
